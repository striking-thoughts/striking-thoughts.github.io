Named after after Bruce Lee's book on wisdom for daily living, Striking Thoughts.
{{< /lead >}}

**Striking Thoughts** is inspired by Bruce Lee's philosophy, which deeply resonates with me. I practiced Jeet Kune Do (JKD) at his original studio for a few years and I got to learn a lot from the people there.
> Having previously practiced other martial arts, I found Bruce Lee's "No Way as Way" philosophy particularly beautiful and true.

## No Way as Way Philosophy

Bruce Lee's philosophy teaches that there is no single way to achieve something.  
Instead, he encourages the idea that there are many ways, and one should be flexible and adaptable.   
One of the things I appreciated was how he drew parallels of his philosophy across many areas of life, encouraging others to question his ideas and philosophies.

> **In Martial Arts**  
> There is no one correct way to kick or punch. Adapt your style to the challenge ahead.

> **In Everyday Life**  
> Flexibility and adaptability lead to a better life by helping you overcome challenges.

### In Game Development
I believe the same principles apply to software development and even more so to game development due to the diversity of domains it includes. When solving a problem, whether by yourself or in a group, it is very important to be flexible and adaptable. Being open to exploring different ways to achieve something is a really good recipe for innovation. Being aware that there might be another way of solving a problem can help you step back and think about the problem differently.

## StrikingThoughts.io
Since I am always thinking and thinkering with different game dev ideas, Striking Thoughts felt like a fitting name.
