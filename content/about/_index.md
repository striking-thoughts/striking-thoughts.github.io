I often try to embody Bruce Lee's philosophy of adaptability and flexibility in various aspects of my life.  
Thus, I named this website—my creative outlet—after his book *Striking Thoughts*.

## The Philosophy

Bruce Lee's *No Way as Way* philosophy teaches that no single path is the right one —**Adaptability is key.**  
I practiced Jeet Kune Do (JKD) at his original studio and found this mindset invaluable, not just in martial arts but in life.

> **In Martial Arts**  
> There’s no single correct way to strike. Adapt to the situation.  
  
> **In Life**  
> Flexibility helps navigate challenges.  
  
> **In Game Development**  
> Openness to different solutions fosters innovation.
