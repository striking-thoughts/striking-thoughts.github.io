This was my first experience with VR.  
I joined the Seattle VR Hackathon without knowing anyone and I met some people whom I still keep in touch with.  
Since I didn't know any VR development, I falled back to my Unity experience and did all my development without the need of a VR headset and when my work was done, I shadowed someone else who integrated it into the VR environment.  

We used HTC Vive Trackers to track our baseball bat and also a chair that was our shield and the player could move it around to use it as a shield.  

We won the Novelty award in the hackathon.
