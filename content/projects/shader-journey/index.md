as I explain in my personal blog, [the shader journey](https://notes.tiago.dev/post/projects/shader-journey/), I am fascinated with what Technical Artists can create. It is such a deep and beautiful area of programming.  
Hence, I wanted to learn more about it to further my skills in game development.  

I made a little webgl viewer to showcase the shaders I have learned to write:  
<a href="/shader-journey-frame/index.html">see it in fullscreen</a>  
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <div style="width: 100%; position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;"> <!-- 16:9 aspect ratio -->
        <iframe src="/shader-journey-frame/index.html" title="The Shader Journey" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"></iframe>
    </div>
