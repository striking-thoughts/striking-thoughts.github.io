Rocket jump around the map in a capture the flag online shooter!  
You can explore the game on your own, but it is more fun to play with some friends.  


## What is Rocket Jump?
I had some free time after work, so I decided to learn how to use the Unreal Engine.  
I explore it a bit on my own and really enjoyed it. So I found a course that could serve as a hands on guided tour around some of the features of the engine.    

After completing it, I took away a few things we had done and added a few of my own.

### Rocket Jumping
- weapons have a push back force which allows you to jump/fly

### Fall Damage
- if you hit the ground with a velocity higher than a certain value, you get damaged
- this makes so while you can use your weapon to move faster and higher, you need to think about slowling down when landing.

<!-- ## How can I play it?
You can download it here
- LINK TO DOWNLOAD

While you should be able to launch the game, host a session, and explore the map and game mechanics.  
The the multiplayer aspect might need some additional steps. 
if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

### option 1 : I will add you to my steam dev group
- send me a message and I will invite you to my steam app group, which will allow you to play the game with whoever else is online
### options 2 : modify the steam app id to point to your own app id
- modify the steam app id to point to an app id that you own.
- I don't recommend using the 480 steam app id since that is meant for development testing purposes. -->
