      <description>This game was created by a group of friends who wanted to get together for fireworks and knew that doing that in the physical world would not be safe due to COVID19.
We then got together to create a VR experience that allowed us to shoot fireworks while respecting the social distancing guidelines and rules.
After shooting fireworks for a while, we just sat by the camp fire and talked for a while.</description>

      <description>This was my first experience with VR.
I joined the Seattle VR Hackathon without knowing anyone and I met some people whom I still keep in touch with.
Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know any VR development, I falled back to my Unity experience and did all my development without the need of a VR headset and when my work was done, I shadowed someone else who integrated it into the VR environment.</description>
