      <description>This game was created by a group of friends who wanted to get together for fireworks and knew that doing that in the physical world would not be safe due to COVID19.
We then got together to create a VR experience that allowed us to shoot fireworks while respecting the social distancing guidelines and rules.
After shooting fireworks for a while, we just sat by the camp fire and talked for a while.</description>
