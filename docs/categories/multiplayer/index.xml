      <description>Rocket jump around the map in a capture the flag online shooter!
You can explore the game on your own, but it is more fun to play with some friends.
What is Rocket Jump? I had some free time after work, so I decided to learn how to use the Unreal Engine.
I explore it a bit on my own and really enjoyed it. So I found a course that could serve as a hands on guided tour around some of the features of the engine.</description>

      <description>This experience is inspired on the game &amp;ldquo;Superluminal&amp;rdquo; (link to steam). The goal was to see how it would feel to play with this perspective mechanic in VR.
it is pretty amazing!

      <description>This game was created by a group of friends who wanted to get together for fireworks and knew that doing that in the physical world would not be safe due to COVID19.
We then got together to create a VR experience that allowed us to shoot fireworks while respecting the social distancing guidelines and rules.
After shooting fireworks for a while, we just sat by the camp fire and talked for a while.</description>
