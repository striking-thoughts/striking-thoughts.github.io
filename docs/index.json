Adapt your style to the challenge ahead.\nIn Everyday Life\nFlexibility and adaptability lead to a better life by helping you overcome challenges.\nIn Game Development #\rI believe the same principles apply to software development and even more so to game development due to the diversity of domains it includes. When solving a problem, whether by yourself or in a group, it is very important to be flexible and adaptable. Being open to exploring different ways to achieve something is a really good recipe for innovation. Being aware that there might be another way of solving a problem can help you step back and think about the problem differently.\nStrikingThoughts.io #\rSince I am always thinking and thinkering with different game dev ideas, Striking Thoughts felt like a fitting name.\nHere at StrikingThoughts.io, you will find my experiments, games, and prototypes around game development.
